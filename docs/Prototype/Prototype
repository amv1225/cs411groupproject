We chose React as our main language because React's component-based architecture allows developers to
break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components, which makes it easier to build and maintain complex 
real estate websites as each component can be easily managed and updated independently. Additionally, React is known 
for its high performance and speed due to its use of a virtual DOM, which minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM 
and leads to faster rendering and better performance, making it a suitable choice for real estate websites that require fast loading times.

We chose MySQL because MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is a reliable and robust choice for holding profiles.
It is a relational database, which means that it organizes data in tables with relationships between them, making it easy to manage and query 
profile data, as it can be stored in multiple tables with connections between them. Additionally, MySQL is designed to be scalable and can handle 
large amounts of data, making it suitable for profile databases that may need to store a large number of user profiles and related information.
MySQL is also known for its high performance and ability to handle multiple concurrent users and transactions, which is important for profile databases 
that may experience heavy traffic and need to respond quickly to user queries. Furthermore, MySQL has a strong security model that includes user 
authentication and access control, making it a suitable choice for profile databases that may contain sensitive information that needs to be protected.
