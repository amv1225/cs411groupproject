Real Estate web app: Using real estate listing and census data, the user will be able to select a listing and compare it to average
listings using the census data to see whether the listing is good or not. The website will have listings that we will get from the US Real Estate API, and 
it will tell a user facts about the listing such as if it a good buy or not depending on location

Spotify Genre Generator: Using the Spotify API we would generate playlists based on the user's emotion by providing a mood tracking questionnaire. 
The playlist takes into account the user's preffered genres and artists to generate a playlist that both fits the user's mood and matches their preferences.
