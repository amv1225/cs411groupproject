Pitch 1: Real Estate(US Real Estate API) and US Census data API

 - The user can search by demographics using the census data and find whether real estate listings are good or bad.
 - Database: Oracle
 - Third Party OAuth: Google(Gmail) authentication
 - Front End: Website that asks the user to input a property and recommend whether the listing is good or bad.
 - Back End: Use the census data to find the demographics of the area, and use the real estate API to match that with the listing.
