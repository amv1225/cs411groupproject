User Story #1:
As a frequent shopper who is moving to a new location, I want to easily find houses that are conveniently near businesses without the hassle of multiple steps and tedious searches. Recently, I've noticed that finding a home or local business has become more difficult and time-consuming, causing frustration and discouraging me from making purchases. I want a website that is more streamlined and helps me find a home that offers both convenience to nearby businesses and helps me find the best house in terms of location and price.
