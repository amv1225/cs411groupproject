Real Estate web app: Using real estate listing and census data, the user will be able to select a listing and compare it to average
listings using the census data to see whether the listing is good or not. The website will have listings that we will get from the US Real Estate API, and 
it will tell a user facts about the listing such as if it a good buy or not depending on location
